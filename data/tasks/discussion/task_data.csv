0,"""Astrology""",26,"Astrology is the belief that the positions of the stars and movements of the planets of the Solar System, including asteroids and other stars, have an influence on the events, lives, and behavior of people. An astrologer looks at the planets’ positions and tries to understand a person’s character or tries to predict the future. Astrology and astronomy started out as the same thing, but today they are very different. Newspapers and websites often print or post horoscopes. These horoscopes claim to predict a person’s future based on their birth sign.",2,"{Can you guess the star signs of the people in your group?,Do you personally believe in astrology? Why/why not?,Why do you think some people are fascinated by astrology?}"
1,"""Stress""",26,"There is a famous expression in English: Stop the world, I want to get off! This expression refers to a feeling of panic or stress that makes a person want to stop whatever they are doing, try to relax, and become calm again. 'Stress' means pressure or tension. It is one of the most common causes of health problems in modern life. There are numerous physical effects of stress. Stress can affect the heart. It can increase the pulse rate, make the heart miss beats, and can cause high blood pressure. Stress can affect the respiratory system. It can lead to asthma. It can cause a person to breathe too fast, resulting in a loss of important carbon. Stress can affect the stomach. It can cause stomach aches and problems digesting food.",2,"{Which effects of stress have you experienced?,In which situations do you experience stress?,Can you propose strategies that are helpful in dealing with stress; what can calm you?,Do you think that stress is only constructed by one's head?}"
2,"""Accupuncture""",26,"Acupuncture stimulates various points in the body that are believed to house qi or energy. It is the clearing of blockages in qi that mystics believed healed people. Today, modern acupuncturists target the sites in the body that help stimulate healing. Some of these are pressure-point areas. After treatment, people report feeling more awake and stimulated than before the session.Chronic conditions, like back or musculoskeletal conditions, often involve a combination of medications and physical therapy to keep the pain at a minimum. Doctors have begun prescribing acupuncture as a part of treatment plans to give patients the most chance of finding relief for painful conditions.",3,"{What are the pros and cons of acupuncture?,Have you ever experienced acupuncture and if no are you willing to give it a try? Why or why not?,What other alternatives to conventional medicine do you know about?}"
3,"""Colors and Emotions""",26,"I'm green with envy. I'm so angry I'm seeing red. I'm feeling really blue today. We definitely tend to link colors with emotions and there's been plenty of psychological and social research on how specific colors actually influence our moods and actions. But, the effects of color aren't written into our DNA, they're set by personal experience. The cultures we live in also tend to dictate how we read certain colors. For example, in western cultures white often represents purity and innocence, but in some eastern cultures it's the color of mourning.",2,"{Do you have the same assocations between moods and colors as mentioned in the text? For example what does red mean to you?,What are some color and mood associations that exist in your native language?,What happens if cultural color assocations are opposites?}"
4,"""Hiking""",21,Hiking is a general word for traveling on foot in wilderness or countryside. Day hikers return before nightfall. Other hikers may go out for many days. Sometimes large groups hike together. Hiking is a kind of physical activity as well as a leisure activity (a way of spending free time). Hikers (the people who do hiking) enjoy fresh air and the beauty of nature while also learning about the place. Many hikers enjoy challenging their physical and mental strength. Hiking with friends gives them the chance to become stronger.,2,"{Do you think hiking is more of a leisure activity (free time) or a physical activity (sport)?,Are you a hiker? If so do you go alone or with a group?,Would you rather go on a one-day-hike or travel for days?}"
5,"""Distracted driving""",21,"Distracted driving is the number one cause of motor vehicle accidents on today’s roads. Distracted drivers miss traffic signals, hit pedestrians, and swerve into wrong lanes. Failing to notice that traffic has come to a stop is one of the most deadly mistakes they make. Sending or reading a text takes your eyes off the road for 5 seconds. At 55 mph, that’s like driving the length of an entire football field with your eyes closed., says the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (US)",2,"{Which is more dangerous to do while driving: eat take a phone call or respond to a text?,In what ways do passengers distract drivers?,What should be the penalties for distracted drivers? Should young drivers face greater penalties than experienced drivers?}"
6,"""Children Owning a Dog""",21,"Brendan's best friend is Tip. Tip and Brendan are inseparable. They teach each other things and they look after each other. Tip has helped Brendan become more responsible, more caring, and a better friend. Brendan is a nine-year-old boy, and Tip is a ten-year-old dog. Brendan and Tip are an example of how owning a dog can have a positive effect on a child's development. Having a dog develops a child's sense of responsibility, broadens his capacity for empathy, and teaches the nature of friendship.",1,"{What advantages / disadvantages do you see in having a dog as a child?,Do you prefer another pet over a dog? Why/why not?,Do you believe that having a dog teaches the nature of friendship? Why/why not?}"
7,"""Volunteering""",21,"With busy lives, it can be hard to find time to volunteer. However, the benefits of volunteering can be enormous. Volunteering offers vital help to people in need, worthwhile causes, and the community, but the benefits can be even greater for you, the volunteer. The right match can help you to find friends, connect with the community, learn new skills, and even advance your career.Giving to others can also help protect your mental and physical health. It can reduce stress, combat depression, keep you mentally stimulated, and provide a sense of purpose.",2,"{Why do people volunteer? Can you list some reasons?,What types of volunteer work would be unpleasant for you?,Do you believe that volunteering could advance your career? How?}"
8,"""Life in a lighthouse""",27,"Luke has an amazing home – he lives in a lighthouse. In fact you can hear the sea every day, says Luke. It’s not really a quiet place, it’s often windy and there are many noisy birds calling. There are no cars or people near but there’s always a lot of sound. Inside the lighthouse it’s much quieter. The walls and windows are very thick to protect the building from storms.The building is no longer a working lighthouse although there’s still a light at the top for the ships. Many lighthouses are empty now, and some don’t have a light, says Luke. It’s quite easy to buy one to live in. Luke is a writer and for him it’s an ideal home.",1,"{What advantages / disadvantages are there to live in a lighthouse?,Would you enjoy living in an isolated place with no people nearby?,What other unusual place to live can you think of?}"
9,"""The Wild Life""",27,"Long before the arrival of Europeans on the Canadian prairie (the wide grasslands of what is now called Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba), the First Nations people lived in a harmonious relationship with their natural surroundings. Every item of their culture, from sewing needles to homes, was obtained from nature. Their homes were called teepees and were like large tents made from the skins of deer. These people - tribes with names like the Blackfoot, the Peigan and the Blood people - were nomadic, which means that they travelled from place to place following the animals they hunted or the growth of the berries and fruits on the bushes and trees.",3,"{What advantages are there to move your home?,Do you see yourself moving from one place to another in your life or would you prefer to find one place and live there for a long time?,Do you think people live in a harmonious relationship with their natural surroundings today? Why/why not?}"
10,"""interior design""",27,"An interior designer is someone who works with a client to create aesthetic rooms and spaces. Clients range from homeowners to large corporations. The spaces and rooms interior designers create are equally varied, ranging from simple indoor and outdoor home environments to hotel lobbies and lavish mansions. No matter the size, every interior designer works to create spaces that are attractive yet functional. Spaces must also be safe while meeting the specific needs of the client.",3,"{If you were given the chance would you hire a professional or would you prefer to design your own house interiors? Why/why not?,What areas of knowledge must an interior designer have?,What is the difference between an architect and an interior design expert?}"
11,"""Human Developing""",22,"When early humans hunted and gathered food, they were not in control of their environment. They could only interact with their surroundings as lower organisms did. When humans learned to make fire, however, they became capable of altering their environment. To provide themselves with fuel they stripped bark from trees, causing the trees to die. Clearings were burned in forests to increase the growth of grass and to provide a greater grazing area for the wild animals that humans fed upon. This development led to farming and the domestication of animals. Fire also provided the means for cooking plants which had previously been inedible. Only when the process of meeting the basic need for food reached a certain level of sophistication was it possible for humans to follow other pursuits such as the founding of cities.",2,"{Do the humans of today face the same problems that early humans did?,Early humans caused the trees to die in order to provide themselves with fuel. Is that any different from what the humans of today are doing?,Humans fed upon wild animals. Do you think it was acceptable at the time? Do you think it is acceptable today?}"
12,"""Romulus and Remus""",22,"The early history of the city of Rome involves Romulus and Remus, two orphan boys who, legend says, were raised by a she-wolf. The boys' mother had been murdered by an evil king and the two babies tossed into the river Tiber. When the wolf found them she carried them back to her cave and fed them on her milk. The boys grew bigger and stronger and, eventually, were found by a herdsman who took them home and raised them. When they reached manhood they sought revenge on the king who had killed their mother and driven them from their home.They decided to build a city. Unfortunately, they argued over the appropriate site and Romulus killed his brother Remus. Romulus ruled this city -- called Roma -- for thirty-seven years.",1,"{How would you imagine the city of Rome or how would you describe it if you have been there?,What stories are there about your hometown or other cities you know?,Why would / wouldn't you like to be raised by a wolf?}"
13,"""Getting Tattoos""",22,"Jack lay, quiet and unmoving, for thirty minutes while a stranger repeatedly stabbed him with sharp needles, causing blood to pour steadily out of his leg. Jack was getting a tattoo. His friend Tony had recently gotten a tattoo, and Jack was so impressed by Tony's bravery and his tattoo that he decided to get one too. Getting a tattoo because your friends and peers have them is just one of the reasons why a lot of young people in North America get tattoos. Peer pressure, media influence, and personal expression are some of the common reasons for wearing tattoos today.",2,"{Which reasons are there to get a tattoo?,Would you want to get a tattoo? Why/Why not?,Can you think of other examples you do because your friends and peers do them?}"
14,"""Ocean Pollution""",24,"Each year, billions of pounds of trash and other pollutants enter the ocean. Where does this pollution come from? Where does it go? Some of the debris ends up on our beaches, washed in with the waves and tides. Some debris sinks, some is eaten by marine animals that mistake it for food, and some accumulates in spinning ocean currents. Other forms of pollution that impact the health of the ocean come from sources like oil spills or from accumulation of many dispersed sources, such as fertilizer from our yards.",3,"{Can you think of sources of pollution?,What could you yourself do to decrease pollution?,How does ocean pollution affect humans?}"
15,"""Animal Testing""",24,"Animal testing is vital to biomedical research. There is simply no way around this. When possible, many scientists prefer experiments with tissue culture or computer models because they are usually cheaper and easier than using live animals. But these other techniques cannot fully replace animal testing. This is a necessary evil that is not considered controversial in the scientific community.",2,"{What are the disadvantages of animal testing?,Which products that are based on animal testing do you use or know of?,Can you think of other necessary evils?}"
16,"""Floods""",24,"Floods are second only to fire as the most common of all natural disasters. They occur almost everywhere in the world, resulting in widespread damage and even death. Consequently, scientists have long tried to perfect their ability to predict floods. Although scientists cannot always predict exactly when floods will occur, they do know a great deal about when floods are likely, or probably, going to occur. Deep snow, ice-covered rivers, and weak dams are all strong conditions for potential flooding. Hopefully, this knowledge of why floods happen can help us reduce the damage they cause.",2,"{Which regions might be especially at risk of being flooded?,Which natural desasters (or something close) have you encountered already?,Do you think the tendency to flooding is increasing or decreasing?}"
17,"""Elephats Don't Jump""",24,"Adult elephants just aren't built to jump because they often weigh 16,000 or more pounds, so they're too heavy to make the leap. Not only do they not jump, elephants never get all four feet off the ground at once - even when charging at full speed. So, technically, I guess, elephants don't actually run, they power walk. And why should they jump? The great leapers of the animal kingdom often evolved that skill as a way of avoiding predators, but nothing in an elephant's environment, at least in their recent evolutionary past, required them to hop around.",2,"{What kind of animals do you know that jump very well or very high? Do you agree with the article's explanation for their jumping skill?,What would happen if humans lost the ability to jump?,What would happen if elephents gained the ability to jump?}"
18,"""Grey Hair""",24,"Hair gets its color when two types of pigment called melanin combine. Different proportions create a variety of shades. We don't yet understand the mechanics behind it, but hair follicles (the 100,000 or so pits on our heads that sprout our hairs) produce less melanin as we age. The result is gray hair. While we could probably point a finger at stress, the timing of this color change is mostly a function of the genes you inherited from your parents.",3,"{What's the youngest age you know someone started going grey? Do you think their life was very stressful?,Do people make unfair judgements about others if they have grey hair?,Which hair styles in general do you like?}"
19,"""Human Senses""",24,"Sensing– The process of neurons communicating information from the environment and from within the body (but outside of the brain) to the brain. Senses have dedicated biological processes (sensory system, receptors, brain regions that consolidate information) and dedicated mental aspects (sharpness of sound, rough texture).Depending on how you define a sense, we actually have between 5 and 33 of them. Beyond the classics, we have a sense of balance and the ability to sense heat and time, along with all kinds of other cool spidey senses.",2,"{What are some other senses you think humans have?,If you had to lose one sense you already have which one would you choose?,What sense that another animal has which humans don't would you like to have?}"
20,"""Body Heat""",24,"Despite all the heavy lifting going on up there, it's totally false that we lose most of our body heat through our heads. The amount of heat we lose depends on how much skin surface area is exposed to the cold, so, yes, you'll lose more heat through a bald head than a gloved hand, but the opposite is just as true.",1,"{What kind of clothes are good for cold climates?,What is the climate in your country and area?,How do weather changes influence the type of clothes you usually wear?}"
21,"""Trees With Email""",24,"When officials in Melbourne, Australia rolled out a program that assigned email addresses to trees in a bid to help identify damage and issues, they discovered that city residents preferred to write them love letters instead. Instead of damage reports, people began to write fan mail to trees, complimenting their looks and leaves and telling tales of how they'd helped them survive during inclement weather. Some trees even write back. The effort is part of a larger initiative to protect Melbourne's 70,000 city-owned trees from drought and decline.",2,"{Is asking community members to report damage or issues a good way to protect trees or other parts of the environment?,What do you think of the love letters to the trees? What would you write?,Have you ever written a fan mail or could imagine writing one? To whom?}"
22,"""Polar Bear Tourism""",24,"Like clockwork every fall, hundreds of polar bears trundle through Churchill, Manitoba on their way to the freezing Hudson Bay, where they will hunt for seals after the ice packs enough to support their weight. Over the years, the animals’ presence has earned the town the distinction of Polar Bear Capital of the World. Today, Churchill’s bear population exceeds its human population—which is just 813. After Fort Churchill shut down, the town might have been in dire financial straits were it not for its burgeoning bear tourism industry. Today, some 10,000 tourists descend on the town for six weeks in autumn to see them every year. The word is out that this Western Hudson Bay population of bears, Churchill Bears, are going to be the first population of polar bears to become extinct. ",3,"{What do you think Churchill would be like without the polar bears?,Should tourists be allowed to go Churchill to see polar bears?,Is there something Churchill can do to help the polar bears?}"
23,"""Federalism""",23,"Federalism is a mixed mode of government that combines a single general/central government with multiple regional/local governments. The idea is to share laws and power between these two different levels. Sharing this power has two main goals. One goal is to safeguard and promote unity, because of a mutual trust and agreement to live together, i.e. in a cooperative way. The second goal is to accommodate diversity in religion, language, or ethnic group. Examples of federal states include India, Germany, the United States, Brazil, and many more.",3,"{Do you live in a federal state? If so do you like it? If not would you like to live in one?,What are the advantages and disadvantages of federalism?,Do you think that federalism is a good way of accommodating diversity in religion language or ethnic groups?}"
24,"""Why We Like Junk Food""",23,"A lot of money, strategy and effort goes into designing junk food. The goal is to make it cheap, convenient and -- despite having little to no nutritional value -- to keep you wanting more. It's typically high in things like salt, sugar and fat, which trigger pleasure centers in our brains, making us feel good and encouraging us to keep eating. Our brains are relatively big and they require a lot of energy to do their thing, so we evolved to love high-energy food. Beyond the super high calorie count, junk food makers have a million tricks up their sleeves when it comes to making their products irresistible. So despite knowing it's not good for us -- eating it is linked with things like obesity, diabetes, heart disease and even cancer -- junk food can be really hard to resist.",2,"{Do you enjoy junk food? Why or why not?,What kind of food do you share with friends or at get togethers?,How can people be convinced to NOT eat junk food?}"
25,"""Cricket Soup""",23,"At Le Cordon Bleu, the esteemed French cooking school, chefs and food scientists spent a week simmering, sauteing and grilling insects to extract innovative flavors they say could open a new gastronomic frontier. The insects were not visible in the final products but artfully hidden, pureed into batters, their juices extracted for essence. A Cordon Bleu chef, Christian May, admitted privately that he was initially repulsed by the intense aroma of the grilled crickets for the broth. He encouraged his colleagues not to demonstrate for the seminar how the consomme was made but just serve it elegantly on trays, which they did.",3,"{Have you eaten insects or any other weird food before? If not would you be brave enough to try?,What is your country national food? Do you have any weird dishes?,If you were to choose 3 insects to eat which 3 would you choose?}"
26,"""3D Printing""",29,"3D printing is a rapidly growing technology that many consider to be the future of custom manufacturing. However, that was not always the case. When 3D printing was introduced decades ago, it was seen as a slow, gimmicky technology with no real-world use. It was occasionally used for design and prototyping, but was never viewed as a viable option for most companies’ manufacturing floors. Nonetheless, in the last 10 years the technology has taken off, garnering large investments from many of the top manufacturers in the world.",3,"{Which industries and in what ways can benefit from 3D printers most?,The text mentions one important invention. What other  inventions in your opinion changed the world? Why are they so important?,Did invention of the Internet cause more harm or more good? Why?}"
27,"""Cars of the future""",29,"Imagine a car of the future!    This car is the opposite of todays' cars; today's cars are noisy and dirty, this one is silent and clean. Today's cars have wheels, this one does not. It moves like a snail, but much faster than a snail !    This car will use electric energy, not petrol or gasolene; it will have batteries that can be recharged instantly from chargers in the road. It will also be very easy to drive. A lot of the technology already exists, but it is very experimental.  Already today scientists are developing new materials for the surface of roads: In fifty years from now, perhaps sooner, some new roads will capture solar energy : they will store this energy under the road, and some cars will be able to use it.",2,"{How do you imagine transport to be in the future?,What are the advantages / disadvantages of such a future car?,Why would/wouldn't you want the car of the future to drive on its own?}"
28,"""Internet of Things""",29,"The Internet of things (IoT) is becoming an increasingly growing topic of conversation both in the workplace and outside of it. It's a concept that not only has the potential to impact how we live but also how we work. But what exactly is the Internet of things and what impact is it going to have on you, if any?Simply put, this is the concept of basically connecting any device with an on and off switch to the Internet (and/or to each other). This includes everything from cellphones, coffee makers, washing machines, headphones, lamps, wearable devices and almost anything else you can think of.",2,"{What do you think about current smart devices?,Do you think this will cause privacy issues that we should think about? If yes what are they?,In which areas do you think this IoT could become most helpful to us?}"
29,"""Holidays in Space""",29,"A Japanese company, Shimizu, plans to open the first hotel in space within 15 years.    They want to offer 3-day holidays in a space station, which will be bigger than the International Space Station. However, holidays in space will be very expensive! About 90,000 dollars for three days! But they cannot yet start building their orbiting hotel.    First they will have to buy a commercial re-usable shuttle. Today there are no shuttles. The old American shuttles, such as Atlantis and Columbia, were very expensive to launch. They had to be launched into orbit with a big rocket which cannot be re-used.However, there are other big difficulties too. How will ordinary people react to life in space? Today's astronauts spend months training before going into space.",2,"{Would you like to go on holidays in space?

30,"""Food Powder""",25,"Next time you toss rotten lettuce or moldy berries you should think about this. Globally, we waste more than a third of the food we produce. A group of Swedish graduate students is working to fight that fact. They have come up with a way to use produce that is about to go to waste. It may help people who have limited access to food. They are calling it FoPo Food Powder. It is exactly what it sounds like. It is dried, powdered, shelf-stable fruits and vegetables. The powder can be dropped into relief efforts after natural disasters. Or it can be given out in low-resource areas where fresh food and refrigeration are hard to come by. ",2,"{Is it appropriate to create low-cost food from almost rotten food?,People nowadays throw away a lot of food. Is it common in your family? How can we reduce the amount of food waste?,Would you buy and use food powder or would you prefer fresh fruits and vegetables?}"
31,"""Britain's Reputation""",25,"Britain suffers - often unfairly - from a reputation as a country where the food is bad. According to popular belief, the British live on a diet of boiled meat, mealy sausages, sugary baked beans, or greasy fish 'n' chips covered with vinegar .....Much has been written and said about dietary disasters such as chip butties, or culinary calamities like deep-fried chocolate bars – reputedly popular in the northern parts of Britain; and an official report recently warned that 50% of the British population could be obese by 2040. So yes, plenty of people in Britain do not eat well or healthily; but for those who do enjoy good cooking and fine food, there is plenty to offer.",2,"{What causes an increase of obesity nowadays?

32,"""Alcohol in America""",25,"Today, in America, you cannot use hard drugs, because it is against the law. But today, you can sit in a bar and drink a beer — just as long as you are not below the age limit;  a hundred years ago, you could not. Alcohol became illegal in the year 1919; it remained illegal for fourteen years.However, it never disappeared! In place of big business, there was big crime. The Mafia took control of the distribution, and the bosses of the Mafia replaced the bosses of the breweries and the distilleries. The biggest gangster of them all was Al Capone, who came from New York and operated in Chicago",1,"{Do you think that alcohol should be illegal?

33,"""Allergen Warnings with Emojis""",25,"Hiroyuki Komatsu, a Google engineer, submitted a proposal to add a range of new icons to the standard emoji library that could help those with food allergies understand what they are eating anywhere in the world. The  reason that emojis are so universal is because they are chosen and developed by the Unicode Consortium, a non-profit corporation that oversees, develops and maintains how text is represented in all software products and standards. Because emojis are everywhere and iconic, they could be helpful for restaurants and food packaging designers to communicate whether a product is made with common allergens. ",3,"{Are emojis a good way to warn people about food contents?,How should the allergens to be warned about and the emojis to indicate them be selected?,Do you or someone you know have food allergies? Have you ever had difficulty determing if a food contained allergens?}"

35,"""Christmas Shopping""",28,"For Britain's shops, especially shops in cities, November and December are the busiest months of the year. In fact, some big shops do half their year's business in those two months.  Yet in 2020, with Covid-19, Christmas shopping was not the same! Many people did not want to go into cities, or into big shopping centers. They were afraid of catching Covid.  More and more people are now shopping on the Internet!

36,"""Scarcity""",28,"Mineral resources, not synthetically producible in human time frames, are fixed in the earth. As each is mined, less supply remains, suggesting that cost and, thus, price must increase as production cumulates.Yet, for virtually all minerals, the opposite seems to be true: As more is mined, more is discovered to be mined. Prices and costs do not inexorably rise. What was high-cost yesterday has become lower-cost, undercutting the perennial complaint that the easy stuff has been found. Overall, there seems to be little difference between minerals and general goods and services.",3,"{Many natural resources (water oil gas forests) are disappearing from the Earth at a critical rate.
